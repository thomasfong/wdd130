                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p> 
	
                <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                    sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
                    ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                    from sun or rain when needed.</p>   
                
                <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                    longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is 
                    higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the 
                    late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like 
                    to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
